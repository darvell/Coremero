# Coremero
.NET Core chat bot that provides abstractions/interfaces to allow any chat service to become a client.
This bot is mostly a 'comedy' bot with a lot of silly commands for the members of an online community of jaded ex-minecraft players.

You can probably fork this and make your own silly joke commands if you're just looking for something to quickly get going for your own community.

## Supported

* Discord
